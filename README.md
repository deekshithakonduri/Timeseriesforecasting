Effective management of inventory and waste is crucial in the food industry, necessitating accurate demand forecasting due to the perishable nature of many products. This study investigates a range of machine learning and deep learning techniques for demand prediction, using the 'Food Demand Forecasting' dataset released by Genpact. It compares the performance of Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Light Gradient Boosting Machine Regressor (LightGBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGBoost), Cat Boost Regressor, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM models. Evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Average Error (MAE) are employed to assess model accuracy. Additionally, this study introduces a novel approach utilizing a convolutional neural network with a 2D architecture (CNN2D) for demand forecasting. Results indicate the CNN2D model's exceptional performance, achieving an MAE of 0.000, RMSE of 0.002, MAPE of 0.000000e+00, and RMSLE of 0.002. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning methodologies, particularly CNN2D, in precisely predicting demand within the food industry, thereby facilitating operational optimization and waste reduction.
